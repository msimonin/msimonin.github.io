This articles shows a simple use of [iruby
notebook](https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby) for interacting with Grid'5000
ressources. The experimentation follows three steps :

1. Get some ressources on Grid'5000 
2. Get the uptime of all the nodes of the reservation
3. Draw a bar plot showing the different uptime of the nodes

## The notebook in details 

Here is the commented notebook  (the plot is at the very end)
